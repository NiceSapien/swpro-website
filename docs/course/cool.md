## Sketchware's history
Sketchware was founded by Sung Woo Park with his team, "Besome", in Korea. It first released in 2016. Due to funding issues, it shut down in 2021. Its last update came out in 2019. A new "Sketchware 2" was promised to be released in 2022, but it never came out. So people started using Sketchware Pro...

## Sketchware Pro's history
Sketchware Pro was created by a little group of individuals as a hobby - view them [here](https://sketchware.pro/team)
It's still regularly updated. It is a modded version of the original Sketchware, which is no longer available.  Sketchware Pro is completely free to use, we don't demand any money. Sketchware Pro does not affect Sketchware's business(atleast not anymore lol) as it has shut down. Many Sketchware Pro users now don't even know about Sketchware. Thanks to the creators of Sketchware for creating such a legendary app!
