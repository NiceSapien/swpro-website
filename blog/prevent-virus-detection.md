title: App detected as a virus? Here's what you can do!

Some Android systems now ship a built-in virus scanner and most suddenly started flagging some Sketchware Pro-built projects as harmful. Here's what you can do to fix it!

## Solution

APK files built by the `Run` button are flagged as "virus", "trojan", or similar harmful sounding terms. However, this is probably caused due to the `testkey` because some virus scanners just identify any app as a virus if its signed using `testkey`. To fix this issue, you can export your project using the Sign/Export menu.

If your project still gets flagged after installing that .apk file generated by the Sign/Export menu, these are the two most probable reasons for it.

- You gotta sign your app using [apk-signer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.haibison.apksigner)
- It's a Local library or some other code in your project.

## Security vendors to ignore
Sometimes that's not enough. There are a few untrustworthy security vendors that often bring up false-positive scan reports, like MaxSecure or Ikarus. As a general rule of thumb, if only a few (1-4) vendors detect "malware" in your project, they're false positives. Contact them and ask them to re-scan your project's .apk file and/or remove the false-positive detection. **Only do this with a signed, exported .apk file though!** See section [*Solution*](#solution) above for more info.

### Success story
For example, Avast had detected `Android:Evo-gen [Trj]` in my demo project's signed and exported .apk file. I filed a false-positive detection form, waited a day or so, and got a mail that they fixed the issue. It used to have 2 detections on VirusTotal.com, [now it has zero](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e079fc195a6365327845fe2f593cb29db68d7b083cc6afc2bdceb2d3345eaa95).
