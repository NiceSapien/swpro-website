Sketchware Pro is a free Android app development platform that allows users to create apps using a block-based programming language. It is a modded version of Sketchware.

Sketchware Pro has been growing rapidly in popularity and recognition, thanks to the efforts of its talented and passionate modders.<!--truncate--> The project has reached 800+ stars on GitHub, and is on the verge of reaching 1000 stars soon. This is a remarkable achievement for a community-driven project that started as a hobby.

To celebrate this milestone, the modders are planning to release a new stable version of Sketchware Pro when they reach 1000 stars. This version will include bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features that will enhance the user experience and functionality of the app.

However, there is also a rumor that this might be the last version of Sketchware Pro ever. The main modder, jbk0 (JavkhlanK), once said that he would stop working on the project after the next stable release. This is not yet confirmed, but it raises some questions about the future of Sketchware Pro.

Will this be the end of Sketchware Pro, or will it be the beginning of a new era? Some modders and contributors, such as Remaker, Ilyasse Salama, Hasrat, and some others, are working on a Material Design port of the app, which is expected to arrive soon. This port will give Sketchware Pro a modern and sleek look, as well as some additional features and options. The modders may even consider it to be the main version of the app after its release or completion.

Whatever happens, Sketchware Pro will always remain a remarkable and innovative app development platform that has inspired and empowered thousands of users around the world. We thank the modders for their hard work and dedication, and we hope that Sketchware Pro will continue to grow and evolve.
